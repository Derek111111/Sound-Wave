About the Project Soundwave:
SoundWave, streams Music from the Internet into your device.
The core feature of the app is that, the user can do a lyric search and get the lyrics of his favorite song from the app through Musixmatch. He can also search playlist for a particular artist from last.fm.
Music streaming is another core function of SounWave. Naturally, it should support uninterrupted streams of music files from last.fm, so that users can enjoy high-quality playback.
SounWave is also Mobile Responsive, hence user can use it from his mobile, tab or desktop.
Future Developments: Our team plans to improve the site by adding user signin option so that we could pull the music played by him/her during his/her last login by validating and authenticating the user in database.

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS (media queries, font-awesome, Boostrap )
