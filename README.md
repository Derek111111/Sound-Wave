About the Project Soundwave:
Our app SoundWave, streams Music from the Internet into your device.
The core feature of our app is that, the user can do a lyric search and get the lyrics of his favorite song from our app through Musixmatch. He can also search playlist for a particular artist from last.fm.
Music streaming is another core function of our application. Naturally, it should support uninterrupted streams of music files from last.fm, so that our users can enjoy high-quality playback.
Our App is also Mobile Responsive, hence user can use it from his mobile, tab or desktop.
Future Developments: Our team plans to improve the site by adding user signin option so that we could pull the music played by him/her during his/her last login by validating and authentication the user in database.
